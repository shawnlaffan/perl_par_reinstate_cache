PAR-Dist-FromPPD
=================

This module creates PAR distributions from PPD XML documents which
are used by ActiveState's "Perl Package Manager", short PPM.

This module parses the PPD document to extract the required
information and then uses PAR::Dist to create a .par archive from it.

PAR has a mailing list, <par@perl.org>, that you can write to; send an empty mail to <par-subscribe@perl.org> to join the list and participate in the discussion.

Please send bug reports to <bug-par-dist-fromcpan@rt.cpan.org>.

The official PAR website may be of help, too: http://par.perl.org
