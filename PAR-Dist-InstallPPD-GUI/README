NAME
    PAR::Dist::InstallPPD::GUI - GUI frontend for PAR::Dist::InstallPPD

SYNOPSIS
      use PAR::Dist::InstallPPD::GUI;
      my $gui = PAR::Dist::InstallPPD::GUI->new();
      $gui->run();

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a Tk GUI front-end to the PAR::Dist::InstallPPD
    module's "parinstallppd" command. You will generally want to use the
    "parinstallppdgui" command instead of using this module.

    The interface to "parinstallppd" isn't done in code via an API. Instead
    "parinstallppdgui" uses IPC::Run to run "parinstallppd".
