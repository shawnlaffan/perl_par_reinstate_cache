PAR-Repository-Client
=====================

This module represents the client for PAR repositories as
implemented by the L<PAR::Repository> module.

Chances are, you should be looking at the L<PAR> module
instead. Starting with version 0.950, it supports
automatically loading any modules that aren't found on your
system from a repository. If you need finer control than that,
then this module is the right one to use.
