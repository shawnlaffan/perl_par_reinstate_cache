PAR-Repository-Query
====================

Originally part of the PAR::Repository distribution,
PAR::Repository::Query was broken out because the PAR::Repository::Client
can make use of the same querying interface. In order to reduce code
duplication, this is now a separate distribution on which both
PAR::Repository and PAR::Repository::Client depend. Both aforementioned
modules inherit from PAR::Repository::Query.
