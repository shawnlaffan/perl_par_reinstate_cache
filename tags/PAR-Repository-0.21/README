PAR-Repository
==============

This module is intended for creation and maintenance of PAR repositories.
A PAR repository is collection of .par archives which contain Perl code
and associated libraries for use on specific platforms. In the most common
case, these archives differ from CPAN distributions in that they ship the
(possibly compiled) output of "make" in the "blib/" subdirectory of the
CPAN distribution's build directory.

You can access a PAR repository using the PAR::Repository::Client module
or the PAR module which provides syntactic sugar around the client.
PAR allows you to load libraries from repositories on demand.
