PAR-Dist-FromCPAN
=================

This module creates PAR distributions from any number of modules
from CPAN.

The L<PAR::Dist> module is used to create .par distributions from an
unpacked CPAN distribution. The L<CPAN> module is used to fetch the
distributions from the CPAN.

PAR has a mailing list, <par@perl.org>, that you can write to; send an empty mail to <par-subscribe@perl.org> to join the list and participate in the discussion.

Please send bug reports to <bug-par-dist-fromcpan@rt.cpan.org>.

The official PAR website may be of help, too: http://par.perl.org
