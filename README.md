perl_par_reinstate_cache
========================

NOT THE OFFICIAL PAR REPO.

This is for work on re-extracting deleted cache files
after some process has cleaned up most of the temp files but
not all.

PAR calls otherwise fail in such cases.  

The official PAR repo is at http://svn.openfoundry.org/par
