Apache/PAR version 0.30
=======================

Apache::PAR is a framework for including Perl ARchive files in a mod_perl (1.x or 2.x) environment.  It allows an author to package up a web application, including configuration, static files, Perl modules, and Registry and PerlRun scripts to include in a single file.  This archive can then be moved to other locations on the same system or distributed, and loaded with a single set of configuration options in the Apache configuration.

These modules are based on PAR.pm by Autrijus Tang and Archive::Zip by Ned Konz, as well as the mod_perl modules.  They extend the concept of PAR files to mod_perl, similar to how WAR archives work for Java. An archive (which is really a zip file), contains one or more elements which can be served to clients making requests to an Apache web server.  Scripts, modules, and static content should then be able to be served from within the .par archive without modifications.
