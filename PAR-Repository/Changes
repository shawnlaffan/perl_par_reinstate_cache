    - FixRT #81332: _is_symlink fails test 157 using fake_symlinks in

0.20  Wed Aug 26 15:19 2009
    - Many temporary-file-locking fixes to make
      PAR::Repository work on FreeBSD (Slaven Rezic)
    - Fix to the test count for MD5 checksums (Slaven Rezic)
    - Documentation/POD fixes (Slaven Rezic)
    - Dependency fix for File::Temp. Require 0.19 (Slaven Rezic)

0.19  Thu Feb 19 16:48 2009
    - Promote to stable version.

0.18_01  Mon Feb  2 02:46 2009
    - Add ignore_provides switch to package injection.
    - Add static dependencies
    - Remove warning in Makefile.PL about symlink support
    - Fix bug in _update_info_version.
    - Add _create_dbm as an abstraction.
    - Slight fixes to 'parrepo' (verbosity)

0.17  Tue Jan 13 19:48 2009
    - Do a chmod(644) of the dbm checksums file after creation.

0.16_02  Thu Oct 23 20:51 2008
    - Occasionally, using defined($hash->{$foo}), we were inserting bogus
      records into the dbs.
    - Archive injection/removal test with symlink conversion in between
    - Slight refactoring of the test code.

0.16_01  Mon Oct 21 00:16 2008
    - Support for running without symlinks finally arrived!
    - fake_symlinks option to the constructor (default if
      symlinks not available)
    - convert_symlinks option to the constructor for converting
      existing repositories with symlinks to those without.
    - Fix to the ::DBM docs: the symlinks DB doesn't have paths.
    - Optimize the symlinks db space usage after deleting from it.
    - Expose the new options with parrepo (with a new command
      convert_symlinks, too)
    - Much improved test suite.
    - No longer use base if @ISA is ample.

0.16     Thu Sep  4 16:21 2008
    - Fix the documentation in ::DBM on the symlinks database.
    - Fix the name of the env. variable for disabling the
      no-symlinks warning on installation. (Cosimo Streppone)
    - Removed the PAR::Repository::ScanPAR module and use the
      PAR::Indexer module from CPAN instead. PAR::Indexer
      is essentially just PAR::Repository::ScanPAR, but usable
      by other distributions.
    - Fixed fallback to Digest::Perl::MD5
    - Finally add some meaningful tests.

0.15     Sun Aug 10 11:48 2008
    - Properly close scripts dbm on DESTROY.
    - Calculate DBM checkums.
    - Require DBM::Deep 1.0012: No more XS dependency.

0.14     Sat Nov  4 22:47 2006
    - Fixed a bug during injection.
    - META.yml now conforms to spec. 1.20.
    - Now including t/00podcover.t

0.13     Fri Sep 15 10:50 2006
    - Broke out PAR::Repository::Query into its own distribution
      so that PAR::Repository and PAR::Repository::Client can share
      the same querying interface.
    - Slight change to the interface!
      modules_dbm(), symlinks_dbm(), and scripts_dbm() now all return
      the name of the temporary file as second return value in order
      to make *_dbm() work consistently across PAR::Repository::Query
      uses.

0.12     Sun Aug 28 10:31 2006
    - Explicitly depending on PAR::Dist 0.18.
    - Added optional POD tests.
    - Fixed spelling error in query output of parrepo

0.11     Sat Aug 28 19:18 2006
    - Relaxed the "query dist" command syntax a bit.

0.10     Sat Aug 28 18:26 2006
    - Implemented querying.
      --> Added Query.pm
      --> Added "query script", "query module" and "query dist" to parrepo

0.03     Thu Aug 10 18:01 2006
    - Added scripts support.
    - Added support for upgrading repository versions.
    - Fixed a dangerous bug in the remove() method. (It didn't work
      correctly for symlinks before!)
    - Removing files from the repository by specifying individual bits
      of information now works.

0.02     Thu Aug 10 15:00 2006
