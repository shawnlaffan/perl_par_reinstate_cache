Revision history for Perl extension PAR::Repository::Client.

0.25  Fri Sep  4 21:29 2009
    - Fix bug with respect to upgrading and priority (fallback=>0)
      repositories.
    - More caching: Add a timeout before fetching checksums again.

0.24_01  Fri Feb 20 15:21 2009
    - Many, many, many improvements to the caching algorithms.
      In fact, I'd go as far as saying that this will be the first
      release where the caching works well.
    - Inter-run caching of the DBMs with local checksum
      re-calculation.
    - Introduce the private-cache-dir setting for controlling the
      caching behaviour.
    - Caching improves run-time of simple test by factor of three.
    - Enforce the use of a temporary directory as a cache dir
      in the tests much more so we are good CPAN testers citizens.

0.24  Thu Feb 19 17:16 2009
    - Promote to stable release

0.23_02  Mon Feb  2 21:14 2009
    - Attempt band-aid fix for a better error recovery in case
      of a failing dependency resolution.
    - Fix for the dependencies test (set arch and perl version
      manually)

0.23_01  Mon Feb  2 01:38 2009
    - "static_dependencies" option for automatic resolution
      of the statically declared dependencies.
    - "get_module_dependencies" and "get_script_dependencies"
      methods returning a list of all PAR distributions from
      the repository required to use a given module or script.
    - Much better abstraction of the (internal) X_dbm methods
    - Upgrading the testing repositories to include deps.
    - Require PAR 0.985 due to minor bug fix for the
      "run script from repository" use case.

0.22_01  Sun Jan 25 23:16 2009
    - Implement/fix auto-upgrading.
    - Require PAR 0.984 for upgrading.
    - Require PAR::Dist 0.43 so install_module doesn't fail
      with newer ExtUtils::Installs

0.21_03  Wed Jan 14 08:00 2009
    - Disable File::Temp exclusive locking or else BSD is
      unhappy.

0.21_02  Tue Jan 13 20:06 2009
    - Support for setting custom cache directories with
      the cache_dir parameter to new().
    - Set PAR_TEMP to a real temporary directory with cleanup
      for the tests so there are not files leftover after
      testing (RT #30018)

0.21_01  Tue Jan 13 18:00 2009
    - Fix return values of modules_dbm and scripts_dbm:
      Formerly, they would only return the hash (not the file)
      if the checksums matched.
    - Fix return value of need_dbm_update on success. Documented
      to be the empty list, was 0.
    - Fix need_dbm_update in case the checksums had never been
      fetched before.
    - Fix autovivification bug in _fetch_module(). (very minor)
    - Fix bug in _fetch_module()
    - Much, MUCH better tests.

0.21  Mon Oct 20 20:49 2008
    - Simple distribution fix. 0.20 was missing a file. Oops!

0.20  Sun Oct 19 18:20 2008
    - Require PAR 0.982: 
    --> Only load PAR.pm when really needed, otherwise load just
        the new PAR::Setup* modules to setup the environment.
    - Support for manually specifying the preferred architecture
      and perl version.

0.18  Tue Jun  3 15:29 2008
    - Don't refetch DBM files when deemed not necessary because the
      checksums match..
    - Add getters for dbm checksums in case the repository
      supports them.
    - Add PAR::Repository::Client::Util for small, common
      private utility methods.

0.17  Sun Jun  1 15:32 2008
    - No autoflushing of DBM::Deep objects.

0.16  Mon Oct 15 10:25 2007
    - Add http_timeout option for HTTP transport.
    - Minor documentation tweaks.

0.15  Mon Oct 29 13:15 2006
    - PAR::Repository::Client::prefered_distribution was silently dropping
      any_version archives because of a typo.

0.14  Mon Oct 12 16:05 2006
    - PAR::Repository::Client::HTTP::_fetch_file was generating rather
      long local file names. In fact long enough file names that some systems
      go belly-up. Now generating shorter file names.

    - Added custom installation targets.

0.12  Fri Sep 15 10:50 2006

    - _scripts_dbm => scripts_dbm
    - _close_modules_dbm => close_modules_dbm
    - _close_scripts_dbm => close_scripts_dbm
